#### Lecture slides:
[Click here for lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BbIJJxXv6dQ4siVwZKt_75FtPzUPPOCRh7aKnoqrbss/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Tools for the final project:
 - [Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2), a taxonomic profiler for metagenomics
 - [VirulenceFinder](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/virulencefinder/src/master/), a tool that identifies virulence genes in microbial genomes
 - [Panaroo](https://gthlab.au/panaroo/#/), a bacterial pangenome analysis package
 - [Breseq](https://github.com/barricklab/breseq/wiki), variant calling for clonal microbial evolution
 - [iRep](https://github.com/christophertbrown/iRep/tree/master), a tool for estimating bacterial genome replication rates
 - [IQ-TREE2](http://www.iqtree.org/), maximum likelihood phylogenomics

We've linked the documentation for each tool to help you get started, but we expect you to find and read literature describing your tool.\
While some of these tools have web-based interfaces, we want you to use the command line versions.

## Lecture 6: Student presentations
During Lecture 1, you and your partner(s) picked a tool.
With your partner(s), you will run that tool on our class data, visualize your results, and present the tool and your findings.
We expect all partners to be involved in all parts of the project.
Your presentations will be 7 minutes long plus an additional 3 minutes for questions.
You will send your slides as a PowerPoint file to Owen via email **before** class.
An example project might be identifying antimicrobial resistance genes in our assemblies and comparing the number of resistance genes across species.
I **strongly** recommend that you start working on this presentation early so you have time to troubleshoot.
Owen and Seth will be available to help you if needed.
